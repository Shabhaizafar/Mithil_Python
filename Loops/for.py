Sure! Here is a list of practice questions to help you understand and practice using `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Python.

### Break Practice Questions

1. Write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 and prints each number. Stop the loop if a number divisible by both 3 and 5 is found.
2. Create a list of strings. Write a loop that iterates through the list and prints each string until it encounters a string that contains the word "stop".
3. Write a loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints each number. Break the loop if you encounter a negative number.
4. Write a program that takes user input in a loop. If the user types "exit", break the loop.
5. Write a program that generates random numbers between 1 and 10. Stop the loop when a 7 is generated.

### Continue Practice Questions

1. Write a loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to 20. Print each number except those that are divisible by 4.
2. Create a list of strings. Write a loop that prints each string except those that contain the letter "a".
3. Write a loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints each number except the number 5.
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers in a loop. Skip the numbers that are less than 10.
5. Write a loop that iterates through the characters in a string and prints each character except spaces.

### Pass Practice Questions

1. Write a loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 and uses the `pass` statement inside the loop.
2. Create a list of numbers. Write a loop that iterates through the list and uses `pass` for each iteration.
3. Write a function that uses `pass` as the function body.
4. Write a conditional statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and uses `pass` for one of the conditions.
5. Write a class definition with a method that uses `pass` as the method body.

These questions should give you a good mix of scenarios to practice using `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Python.
